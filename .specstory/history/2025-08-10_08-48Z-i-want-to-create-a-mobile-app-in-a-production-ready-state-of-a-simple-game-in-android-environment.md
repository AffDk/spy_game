I want to create a mobile app in a production ready state of a simple game in android environment.
1) in the settings of the game, the user should be able to choose the total number of players (by defaults set it to 5) but do not allow the user choose a number less than 3
2) in the settings of the game, the user should be able to choose the number of spies, do a validation that the number of spies should be between 1 to min(floor(total number of players /3), total number of players - 2) (set the default to 2)
3) in the setting the user should be able to choose the time of the game which can be be greater than 5 min, the user only insert the time in terms of minutes, do not allow choosing greater than 60 min
4) at the start, the user should be able to choose start a new game, show the icon.png as the background of the page
5) when the user chooses to start a new game, in the backend the app must pick a single random choice from the word_list.csv file, the file includes a list of words separated by commas, for each game there is a single pick 
6) from the numbers between 1 to the total number of players, the app must randomly pick  as many as the number of spies, these randomly picked ones are the players which should play the role of spies
7) when the user chooses to start a new game, 
    - 7.1) the app must show a slider box, which contains a pushbutton in each row. on top of the slider show the total number of players and the number of spies
    - 7.2) for the first player, there would be only one single push button showing the player number (i.e, player #1), for the i-th players, it will be player #i
    - 7.3) when the user clicks on the button the app must first check whether the player number is among the randomly selected numbers in step 6 
    - 7.4) and if the player is among the randomly selected numbers in step 6, then the play role is a spy, in thise case, a pop-up page must be opened and inform the user that he/she must act as an spy in this game (something like "you are a spy in this game")
    - 7.5) there should be a close button on the pop-up page, otherwise, the page must be automatically closed in 5 second,
    - 7.6) if the player is not among the spies, the selected word in step 5 must be shown in the pop-up window (e.g., the selected word is xxx), like what mentioned above, the user should be able to close the pop-up window or the pop-up window must be closed in 5 sec
    - 7.7) the corresponding pushbutton of player 1 must become inactive in the slider box and a new pushbutton must be populated for the next player (e.g, player #2), the slider must always be showing the latest active pushbutton, at each time, there is only one active pushbutton
    - 7.8) the process from 7.1 to 7.7 must be done for all players one by one so that all player find out their role in the game and the non-spies find out what the chosen word has been in step 5
8) once step 7 has been through all players, the app must show a pushbutton on the page showing "Start the game", make sure that the page is focused on the button and it can be clearly seen
9) once the user pushes the start button in step 8, the page must show a count down timer which counts down based on the duration set in step 3
10) when the timer ends, the mobile alarm must go off for 5 sec and the display must be flashin red
11) after 5 sec of alarm and screen flashing, the page of the app must show that the game time is over and wait for the user to start a new game or close the app (the options must be clearly shown to the user)

additional notes:
- make use of icon.png as the icon of the app on android
- if any of the porivded static inputs like word_list.csv or icon.png can be more easily handled if there are provided in a different format, please specify so I can provided a more optimal choice
- allow the user to add to the word_list by suggesting a new word, this must be done before start of the game in the setting but make sure that the word does not already exist, if it exists in the list, give a warning to the user
- create a test functionality to test the alarm function after the set time so for testing I don't have to wait the entire 5 min
- use a dark theme in designing the mobile app and use the icon as the background of the pages but make the background quite dim so it does not conflic with the fonts

I'll help you create a production-ready Android mobile app for your spy game. Let me first examine the existing files and then set up a complete Android project structure. Now let me check if there are more files and get a better understanding of the workspace: Perfect! I can see you have the icon and word list ready. Now I'll create a complete Android project structure for your spy game. Let me set up the project: Let me create the Android project structure directly. I'll start with the main project files:
